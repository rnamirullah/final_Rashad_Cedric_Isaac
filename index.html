            <p>The phrase “Championship Hangover” is a basketball reference that refers to a team winning an NBA Championship and

                <h2>Potential Causes</h2>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Injuries - Teams that win a championship have the shortest offseason out of all teams.
                            Therefore, they have the least time to recover physically.
                        </li>
                        <li>Players lose the motivation to win a championship</li>
                        <li>Opposing coaches figure out ways to out-strategize the team</li>
                        <li>Teams may not be able to afford to resign key players and they end up leaving to other teams</li>

                    </ul>

                <h2>Statistics Used</h2>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Wins, Losses, and Winning % - wins divided by total games
                        </li>
                        <li>Winning % Differential - Difference between winning % in the following year vs. championship winning season </li>
                        <li>Opposing coaches figure out ways to out-strategize the team</li>
                        <li>Offensive and Defensive Rating - Points scored and points allowed per 100 possessions</li>
                        <li>Net Rating - Difference between offensive and defensive rating</li>
                        <li>Net Rating Rank and Diff. in Net Rating Rank - Where the team's net rating ranked among NBA teams and how that ranking changed between seasons</li>
                        <li>Postseason Success on a scale of 1-5 - 0 (did not qualify for playoffs), 1 (reached first round), 2 (reached second round),
                            3 (reached conference finals), 4 (reached finals), 5 (won finals)
                        </li>
